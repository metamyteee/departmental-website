        <p>Our department is driven by a passion for advancing knowledge through innovative teaching and groundbreaking
            research. We aim to nurture the next generation of physicists equipped to lead advancements in both academia
            and industry, aligning our vision with Indiaâ€™s educational and scientific aspirations.</p>

        <p>We offer a diverse range of academic programs, including M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs, along with the newly
            introduced 4-year B.Tech. Engineering Physics program (launched in 2024-25). These programs combine a solid
            foundation in fundamental physics with the practical skills needed to address real-world challenges,
            preparing students for dynamic careers in science and technology.</p>

        <p>Our faculty members are engaged in pioneering research across a variety of fields, including condensed matter
            physics, high-energy physics, and applications of artificial intelligence in physics. With state-of-the-art
            facilities and more than ten specialized research laboratories, the department fosters a thriving
            environment for inquiry and innovation. Our strong collaborations with global institutions such as CERN,
            ISRO, DAE, and DRDO provide our students and researchers with unparalleled exposure to cutting-edge projects
            and expertise.</p>

        <p>We also host regular colloquia and seminars featuring distinguished scientists and experts. These events
            enrich our academic community, offering opportunities to explore contemporary research topics and engage
            with emerging trends in physics.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your interest in our department. Together, let us continue to push the frontiers of knowledge
            and innovation in physics.</p>
